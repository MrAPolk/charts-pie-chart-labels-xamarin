Building the project
------------------

In order to build this project you'll need a copy of ShinobiCharts. If you don't have it yet, you can download a free trial from the [ShinobiCharts website](link to appropriate section).

If you've used the installer to install ShinobiCharts, the project should just work. If you haven't, then once you've downloaded and unzipped ShinobiCharts, open up the project in Xamarin Studios, and add the ShinobiCharts.framework by right clicking references then clicking edit references then navigate to your copy of ShinobiCharts and click the add button.

If you're using the trial version you'll need to add your license key. To do so, open up ViewController.m and add the following line after the chart is initialised:

    chart.licenseKey=@"your license key";
